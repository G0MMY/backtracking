# Backtracking Algorithm

This web application is a sudoku game that can be played. There is also a button to see how the backtrasckng algorithm find the solution of the sudoku. 

I did this application to teach myself about algorithm visualization and how to do it. I obviously learned a lot about the backtracking algorithm and about React.

###### This application is my second web application ever and isn't representative of my real level in web app development


## How does it work

You can start playing the game. To check if the number the you entered is valid, select the case, then press enter. You can also reset the sudoku by clicking the reset button, which will erase all the values that you wrote. Finally, you can see the visualization of the backtracking algorithm if u double click on the visualization button.
